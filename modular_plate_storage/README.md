# Modular Plate Storage

OpenSCAD designs for modular plate storage systems.

- [modular_plate_nests.scad](./modular_plate_nests.scad): functions for creating modular plate nests to spec
- [footing.stl](./footing.stl): A foot for extruded aluminum verticals to hold a plate stack
- [lid_nest.stl](./lid_nest.stl): A simple nest for holding lids or single plates, with grip points at each corner for clamps/tape/fasteners
- [plate_stack_nest_4_corner.stl](./plate_stack_nest_4_corner.stl): A plate nest designed to be paired with 4 extruded aluminum verticals, with space enough for a pf400 gripper to easily grab the plate from either orientation.
- [support_test.stl](./support_test.stl): A small fit test for the vertical aluminum supports
